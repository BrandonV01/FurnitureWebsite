<h1>Furniture Store</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
A basic webstore for an imaginary furniture store using flask as a framework along with flask-sqlalchemy and sqlite3 for a built in database. 
Users are able to create and log into an acccount, add items to a cart which will be saved per session or user if logged in, and of course purchase items. 
There is an admin user created on running the server which has access to an admin panel manually accessible by going to the /admin subpage.
